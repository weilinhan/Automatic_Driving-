Line patrolling robot based on jetson nano using depth camera intel D435i
Through collaborative teamwork, we developed an intelligent vehicle based on the Jetson Nano chipset and a depth camera. The vehicle is equipped with multiple functionalities, including autonomous line following, obstacle avoidance, and traffic sign recognition. It can intelligently respond to different types of road signs by performing actions such as accelerating, decelerating, maintaining speed limits, and stopping temporarily before resuming its journey.Rapid deployment via docs/First_Steps.adoc
